********* BOX MODEL *********


********* DISPLAY *********
CSS has 4 display properties:

        1.BLOCK : Displays an element as a block element (like <p>,<h>).
                 It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width.

        2.INLINE : Displays an element as an inline element (like <span>,<img>,<a>). 
                 Any height and width properties will have no effect.

        3.INLINE-BLOCK : Displays an element as an inline-level block container. 
                     The element itself is formatted as an inline element, 
                     but you can apply height and width values.

        4.NONE : The element is completely removed.


*********{display: none;}  and  {visibility: hidden;} *********

        {display:none} removes the element from the document.
        It does not take up any space.

        {visibility:hidden} hides the element,
        but it still takes up space in the layout.



********* Rules of default CSS *********
            1. Content is everything.
            2. Order comes from your html code.
            3. Children sit on parents.


********* CSS Positioning *********  

            1.STATIC ( DEFAULT CSS )

            2.RELATIVE (Pushes element relative to its previous position LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, BOTTOM.
                        Adding a margin to the previous position.
                        Follows the html flow , means there is ghost space left for the moved element.)

            3.ABSOLUTE (Pushes element relative to its parent LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, BOTTOM 
                        Adding a margin to the parent.
                        Donot follows the html flow, means the other elements move to cover the ghost space.)
            4.FIXED  ( It fixes the positionof an element while scrolling)



********* CENTERING Elementsw in CSS *********  

          text-align method : 
                This method is used in the parent element. 
                It can align both block and inline elements but 
                if we customize width of an element it DOESNOT work.


           margin method : 
                If our block element has a costomized width ,
                we have to center it by using marign.

                To align an element in the center horizontally:
                [ margin: 0 auto 0 auto; ]  OR,
                [ margin: 0 auto; ] 


********* Font Styling in CSS *********  
        
    use [ font-family: ] property to change font.


    [font-family: "Helvetica Neue",Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;]

        this means the font will be set to Helvetica Neue, 
        if the device doesnt have it , it will be set to Helvetica ;
        if the device doesnt have it , it will be set to Arial ;
        if the device doesnt have it , it will be set to sans-serif ;

   We can embed Google Fonts in our site.

********* Font Sizing *********  

    Pixels: versatile, but not good for responsive websites 
            as they're not scalable;


    EMs: flexible and scalable unit which the browser translates
        into pixel values depending on the font size settings in your CSS;


    REMs: flexible, scalable and always relative to the HTML element;


    Percent: always relative to another value and suitable for responsive web designs;

********* FLOAT and CLEAR ********* 
Used only in case of wrapping text around images not used for positioning.
